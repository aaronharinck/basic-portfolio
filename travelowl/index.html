              <p class="workdetail__intro__text__p">
                The assignment was to define a problem that was currently
                happening at the time (2020) as a result of Covid-19 pandemic.
                This was a group project, during a lockdown. This ment for
                example, that we could only communicate through digitial
                channels.
              </p>

              <div class="workdetail__intro__text--bold">Approach</div>
              <p class="workdetail__intro__text__p">
                Traveling at the time had been greatly reduced, because of the
                lockdown. Lots of children could no longer travel to different
                countries. Which meant that they, often along with their
                parents, were stuck at home. We wanted to know if they often got
                bored and if we could make something that could help them with
                reducing their boredom.
              </p>
              <p class="workdetail__intro__text__p">
                We researched and interviewed parents and teachers to get their
                input. And the product was user tested by a small group of
                children.
              </p>
              <p class="workdetail__intro__text__p">
                The result was travelOwl, an app/game which required more input
                than just tapping away on a screen. The game was wrapped in a
                neat little story to help keep the children engaged. It was
                meant to combine the digital and physical world. Where children
                would paint, tinker, experiment ... in the physical world and
                use it to progress the story of the app in the digital world.
              </p>
              <p class="workdetail__intro__text__p">
                The kind of tasks they had to do and the story they would
                experience were created in such a way that they would maintain a
                strong connection with traveling throughout the app.
              </p>
              <p class="workdetail__intro__text__p">
                We developed a product for children, which meant that we had to
                make lots of researched design choices based on that user group
                (approachable and friendly design, simpler wording, motion
                videos, accessibility features, ...)
              </p>
              <div class="workdetail__intro__text--bold">My role</div>
              <p class="workdetail__intro__text__p">
                The work was equally distributed between all members. We did the
                research phase together, and after a while, in the design phase
                the group split up so that some members could already start with
                the development phase. I noticed that the design phase of the
                project would require a lot more time than originally
                anticipated, so I later switched back from the development team
                to the design team where I kept helping with the design,
                including the motion videos. I also created the case movie when
                we were pressed for time.
